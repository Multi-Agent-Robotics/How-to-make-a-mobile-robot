# How to Make a Mobile Robot
This is a blog like introduction to the steps and component in making a robot. It is made for us as a reminder of all the processes and for everyone who wants to get into building your own mobile robot.

This blog is written using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

To install `mkdocs` and the theme used run:
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run a local webserver serving the statically generated html run:
```sh
mkdocs serve
```
The webserver will listen on `localhost:8000`

## Robot Components
Information on the components used for this mobile robot can be found in the [Robot Components](RobotComponents/IntroductionToRobotComponents.md) documentation.

## Robot Model
Information on the CAD model used in this project can be found in the [Robot Model](RobotModel/README.md) documentation.

## Assembling the Robot
1. **The frame**
   1. Saw the [laths]() to length.
   2. Using [angle brackets]() and the 4 frame pieces, assemble the frame.
   3. Saw the [board]() to size.
